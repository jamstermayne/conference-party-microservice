# Professional Intelligence Platform - Deployment Report
*Generated: August 9, 2025*

## üöÄ Major Deployment Summary

Successfully fixed and deployed the **Professional Intelligence Platform** - a sophisticated Slack-inspired networking application for Gamescom 2025. Resolved critical frontend-backend disconnect and broken onboarding system.

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. Frontend-Backend Disconnect
**Problem**: Live app at conference-party-app.web.app showed basic "Loading events..." interface instead of the sophisticated Professional Intelligence Platform described in documentation.

**Root Cause**: HTML was loading basic event discovery interface instead of Professional Intelligence Platform modules.

**Solution**:
- Updated `public/index.html` to load Professional Intelligence Platform architecture
- Replaced basic event grid with proper controller-based routing system
- Added mobile-first bottom navigation with 5 main sections
- Implemented rich UI components (connection cards, event cards, opportunity cards)
- Added professional styling with Slack-inspired design system

### 2. Onboarding Role Selection Broken
**Problem**: On second onboarding screen, clicking roles was broken - users couldn't select their professional persona and continue.

**Root Cause**: Onboarding system was using optimized event management (`window.$` and `window.DOM`) that wasn't available during initial load.

**Solution**:
- Replaced `window.$.on()` with standard `addEventListener()`  
- Removed dependency on `window.DOM.batch()` - used direct DOM manipulation
- Fixed localStorage operations to use standard `localStorage` API instead of `StorageManager`
- Added console logging for debugging persona selection
- Maintained all professional onboarding features and styling
