## Architecture Principles Followed

### 1. Single Responsibility
Every module has one clear purpose as documented above

### 2. Multi-tenant Isolation
- Tenant ID required for all operations
- Data isolation per tenant
- Tenant-specific rooms in WebSocket

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- Event bus for internal communication
- Message queue for service-to-service
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### 4. Caching Strategy
- Multi-layer caching (memory, session, persistent)
- TTL-based expiration
- Automatic cleanup

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Batch operations where possible
- Caching of expensive calculations
- Lazy loading of dependencies

## Known Issues (TypeScript Compilation)

The service has remaining TypeScript compilation errors due to:
1. Missing npm dependencies (express-validator, socket.io, @tensorflow/tfjs-node, natural)
2. Type definition issues with middleware
3. Some unused variables (can be cleaned with ESLint)

These can be resolved by:
```bash
npm install express-validator socket.io @tensorflow/tfjs-node natural
npm install --save-dev @types/natural
```

## Testing
Basic structure is in place but comprehensive testing still needed:
- Unit tests for each service
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Load testing for matching algorithm
- WebSocket connection testing

## Next Steps
1. Install missing dependencies
2. Fix remaining TypeScript errors
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Implement production database connections
5. Add monitoring and alerting
6. Deploy to Kubernetes cluster

## Summary
Successfully created a comprehensive matchmaking microservice following the "1 function, 1 thing" principle. Each module has a single clear responsibility while working together to provide sophisticated AI-powered attendee matching with real-time capabilities.
