- Micro-interactions and animations
- Typography and visual hierarchy
- Color theory and contrast ratios

## Design Philosophy
- **Mobile-first**: Start with smallest viewport and enhance
- **Component-based**: Reusable, modular design patterns
- **Token-driven**: Consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- **Performance-conscious**: Optimize for speed and smoothness
- **Accessible by default**: Keyboard navigation, screen readers, high contrast

## Current Focus
Apply the modern 2-column card design system across the entire application:
- Use `card-modern` classes consistently
- Maintain 2-column grid on desktop, 1-column on mobile
- Implement smooth hover effects and shadows
- Ensure proper visual hierarchy with eyebrow text, titles, and metadata
- Apply consistent spacing using design tokens

## Best Practices
1. Always use semantic HTML
2. Implement focus states for keyboard users
3. Test designs at multiple breakpoints
4. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
5. Minimize CSS specificity issues
6. Document design decisions
7. Consider loading states and empty states
8. Implement error handling gracefully

## Tools and Methods
- Design tokens for consistency
- CSS custom properties for theming
- BEM or similar naming conventions
- Component isolation and composition
- Progressive enhancement
- Performance budgets
