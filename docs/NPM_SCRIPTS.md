## Token Management Scripts

### Checking & Validation
```bash
npm run lint:tokens        # Check for hardcoded px values (main linter)
npm run check:tokens       # Alias for lint:tokens  
npm run lint:css          # Alias for lint:tokens
npm run validate:tokens    # Comprehensive token validation
```

### Migration & Fixes
```bash
npm run migrate:tokens       # Preview what would be changed
npm run migrate:tokens:apply # Apply token migrations (with backup)
```

## Usage Examples

### Daily Development
```bash
# Before committing - check your CSS
npm run lint:tokens

# If violations found, see what needs fixing
npm run migrate:tokens

# Apply fixes automatically
npm run migrate:tokens:apply
```

### CI/CD Integration
The `lint:tokens` script is automatically run:
- On every commit (via pre-commit hook)
- On every PR (via GitHub Actions)
- Can be added to build pipeline
