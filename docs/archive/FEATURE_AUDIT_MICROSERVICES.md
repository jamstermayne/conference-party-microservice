# Conference Party Platform - Complete Feature Audit for Microservices Architecture

## Original Scope Requirements vs Microservices Implementation

### ✅ Core Platform Features Required

Based on the Professional Intelligence Platform specification, these are the REQUIRED features that must be present in our microservices architecture:

## 1. Mobile-First Navigation (5 Main Sections)

### Required Sections:
1. **Now** - Real-time dashboard
2. **People** - Professional connections
3. **Opportunities** - Career/business opportunities
4. **Events** - Gaming industry events
5. **Profile** - User profile management

### Microservices Mapping:
```
Navigation Section → Microservice → Frontend Module
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Now               → Events Service      → Events Module
People            → Matchmaking Service → Matchmaking Module
Opportunities     → Matchmaking Service → Matchmaking Module
Events            → Events Service      → Events Module
Profile           → Auth Service        → Auth Module
```

## 2. Professional Networking Systems (5 Systems Required)

### Required Systems (per CLAUDE.md):
1. **OnboardingManager** - 4-persona professional setup
2. **InviteManager** - Exclusive 10-invite quality control
3. **ProximityManager** - Privacy-first location intelligence
4. **OpportunityToggle** - LinkedIn-killer consent-based networking
5. **ConferenceManager** - Cross-conference persistence

### Current Implementation Status:

#### ✅ OnboardingManager → Auth Service + Auth Module
**Location**: `services/auth-service/src/index.ts` + `frontend/src/modules/auth/index.js`
```javascript
// 4 Professional Personas
- Developer
- Publishing
- Investor
- Service Provider
```
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED in Auth Service with profile management

#### ⚠️ InviteManager → Needs Dedicated Microservice
**Current**: Partially in main Firebase Function
**Required**: Separate Invite Service
```javascript
// Required Features:
- 10-invite limit per user
- Deep link handling
- Quality control system
- Trackable invite codes
```
**Status**: ❌ NEEDS MIGRATION to microservice

#### ✅ ProximityManager → Matchmaking Service
**Location**: `services/matchmaking-service/src/index.ts`
```javascript
// GET /nearby endpoint
- Privacy-first location detection
- Venue-based clustering
- Distance calculations
```
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED in Matchmaking Service

#### ✅ OpportunityToggle → Matchmaking Service
**Location**: `services/matchmaking-service/src/index.ts`
```javascript
// Consent-based networking
- lookingFor field in profiles
- Matching algorithms
- No spam approach
```
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED in Matchmaking Service

#### ⚠️ ConferenceManager → Needs Implementation
**Required Features**:
- Cross-conference data persistence
- Historical connection tracking
- Multi-event support
**Status**: ❌ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

## 3. Rich UI Components Required

### Component Requirements:
1. **Connection Cards** - Professional networking cards
2. **Event Cards** - Event discovery cards
3. **Opportunity Cards** - Career opportunity cards
4. **Professional Styling** - Dark theme, Slack-inspired

### Implementation Status:
- ✅ Event Cards → Events Module
- ✅ Connection Cards → Matchmaking Module
- ⚠️ Opportunity Cards → Needs dedicated component
- ✅ Professional Styling → CSS tokens system

## 4. 4-Step Professional Onboarding

### Required Steps:
1. **Persona Selection** (Developer/Publishing/Investor/Service)
2. **Profile Setup** (Name, company, position)
3. **Interest Selection** (Skills, looking for)
4. **Networking Preferences** (Privacy, proximity settings)

### Current Status:
- ✅ Backend: Auth Service supports profile creation
- ⚠️ Frontend: Needs dedicated onboarding flow module

## 5. PWA System Requirements

### Required Features:
- Service Worker with offline support
- Manifest for installability
- Offline search capability (43KB cache)
- Background sync

### Current Status:
- ✅ Service Worker exists in `public/`
- ✅ Manifest.json configured
- ⚠️ Offline search needs integration with microservices
- ⚠️ Background sync needs implementation

## 6. API Endpoints Required

### Original Endpoints (from CLAUDE.md):
```
/health
/parties (events)
/swipe
/sync
/referral/*
/hotspots
/webhook
```

### Microservices Distribution:

#### Events Service ✅
- `/events` (formerly /parties)
- `/search`
- `/days`
- `/sync`
- `/stats`

#### Matchmaking Service ✅
- `/swipe`
- `/matches`
- `/nearby`
- `/profile`

#### Auth Service ✅
- `/login`
- `/logout`
- `/verify`
- `/profile/:uid`
- `/oauth/*`

#### Calendar Service ✅
- `/events` (calendar)
- `/integrations`
- `/availability`
- `/export/ical`

#### Admin Service ✅
- `/stats`
- `/users`
- `/analytics`
- `/system/maintenance`

#### ❌ MISSING - Needs New Services:
1. **Referral Service** - `/referral/*` endpoints
2. **Hotspots Service** - `/hotspots` endpoint
3. **Webhook Service** - `/webhook` for Google Sheets

## 7. Data Flow Requirements

### Required Flow:
```
Google Sheets → Webhook → Firebase Functions → Firestore
PWA → API endpoints → Cached responses
Offline → Service Worker → Local cache → Background sync
Referral Share → Trackable Code → Click Attribution → Analytics
```

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ API Gateway handles routing
- ✅ Firestore integration in all services
- ⚠️ Google Sheets webhook needs dedicated service
- ⚠️ Referral tracking needs implementation
- ⚠️ Click attribution analytics missing

## 8. Performance Requirements

### Required Optimizations:
1. **10,000+ concurrent users**
2. **90% reduction in localStorage operations**
3. **93% reduction in event listeners**
4. **Multi-layer caching**
5. **Circuit breakers**

### Current Status:
- ✅ Circuit breakers in API Gateway
- ✅ Service scaling (3-10 instances)
- ✅ Module-based architecture reduces coupling
- ⚠️ LocalStorage optimization needs frontend work
- ⚠️ Event listener delegation needs implementation

## 9. Controller Architecture Required

### Required Controllers (per CLAUDE.md):
```
HomeController
PeopleController
OpportunitiesController
EventController
MeController
InviteController
CalendarController
```

### Microservices Mapping:
```
Controller              → Microservice(s)
────────────────────────────────────────
HomeController          → Events + Matchmaking Services
PeopleController        → Matchmaking Service
OpportunitiesController → Matchmaking Service (needs enhancement)
EventController         → Events Service
MeController           → Auth Service
InviteController       → ❌ NEEDS NEW SERVICE
CalendarController     → Calendar Service
```

## Microservices Architecture Compliance

### "1 Function, 1 Thing" Principle Check:

✅ **Auth Service** - ONLY authentication/authorization
✅ **Events Service** - ONLY event management
✅ **Matchmaking Service** - ONLY professional networking
✅ **Calendar Service** - ONLY calendar operations
✅ **Admin Service** - ONLY administration

❌ **Missing Services Violating Principle**:
- Invites currently mixed in main function
- Referrals not separated
- Hotspots not isolated
- Webhooks not dedicated
- Analytics scattered

## Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **Create 4 New Microservices**:
   ```bash
   services/
   ├── invite-service/      # NEW
   ├── referral-service/    # NEW
   ├── hotspots-service/    # NEW
   └── webhook-service/     # NEW
   ```

2. **Enhance Frontend Modules**:
   ```bash
   frontend/src/modules/
   ├── opportunities/       # NEW
   ├── onboarding/         # NEW
   └── pwa-sync/           # NEW
   ```

3. **Update API Gateway Routes**:
   - Add routing for new services
   - Update health checks
   - Configure circuit breakers

4. **Implement Missing Features**:
   - 10-invite system
   - Referral tracking
   - Venue hotspots
   - Google Sheets sync

## Validation Checklist

### Core Features Status:
- [x] 5 Main Navigation Sections (partial)
- [ ] 5 Professional Networking Systems (3/5 done)
- [x] Rich UI Components (partial)
- [ ] 4-Step Onboarding (backend only)
- [ ] PWA Complete System (partial)
- [x] Microservices Architecture (5/9 services)
- [x] API Gateway with Circuit Breakers
- [ ] 10,000+ User Support (needs testing)

### Overall Compliance: 60%

**Conclusion**: While the microservices architecture is well-implemented, we're missing ~40% of the required features from the original scope. These need to be added as new microservices to maintain the "1 function, 1 thing" principle.
