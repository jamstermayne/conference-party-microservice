# üö® CRITICAL HANDOVER - SESSION END

## ‚úÖ WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED
1. FIXED BROKEN ARCHITECTURE - All production endpoints working
2. DELETED ALL DANGEROUS TOOLS - No more file-writing tools
3. CREATED PROTECTION DOCS - PROTECTION.md and PRODUCT-PLAN.md 
4. STARTED CSV UPLOAD - Added papaparse, have complete code ready

## üìç EXACTLY WHERE WE LEFT OFF
NEXT STEP: User needs to paste complete index.ts code to replace src/index.ts
- ‚úÖ papaparse installed
- ‚úÖ Complete updated index.ts code created  
- ‚ùå Code NOT YET pasted into actual file
- ‚ùå NOT YET tested/deployed

## üîß IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS
1. User pastes complete index.ts code
2. npm run build
3. npm run deploy
4. Test CSV upload endpoint

## ‚úÖ WORKING URLS (DO NOT BREAK):
- https://health-x2u6rwndvq-uc.a.run.app
- https://partiesfeed-x2u6rwndvq-uc.a.run.app  
- https://handleswipe-x2u6rwndvq-uc.a.run.app

READ: PROTECTION.md and PRODUCT-PLAN.md FIRST

## üîß DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT
- **Platform**: GitHub Codespaces  
- **Firebase Project**: conference-party-app
- **User Workflow**: 1 command ‚Üí 1 response, think first
- **Code Style**: User doesn't edit snippets, provide 100% complete code
- **IAM Fixed**: Organization policy changed from restricted to Google-managed default
- **User Communication**: Be critical, question feasibility, no tool bloat
